# lnblacjack  or Lightning Network Blackjack

This aims to eventually, perhaps someday, be a proof-of-concept for a web-based blackjack game where the player can make bets using bitcoin via the Lightning Network.

Current Status:

Terminal/Text only code has been written. It's very rudimentary and is meant to be built upon to implement further functionality. The very basics work, but that's about it. There's no betting, no splitting, no insurance, etc.. The most that can be said right now is that "it works, kinda". 


NOTE:
Initial code is based on the code in this article:
